# SharpFlow ⚡

> Revolutionary C# automation platform with live code compilation and zero-setup deployment

## 🚀 Why SharpFlow?

**Traditional automation tools make you choose your poison:**
- n8n: Node.js + 1,973 npm packages + setup complexity
- Langflow: Python + C++ compilers + mandatory reboots  
- Enterprise tools: Vendor lock-in + licensing costs

**SharpFlow eliminates ALL compromises:**
- ✅ Single 15MB executable - no dependencies
- ✅ Live C# compilation in workflow nodes  
- ✅ Native AOT performance
- ✅ Visual drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ Enterprise-grade, open source

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Zero Setup**: Download and run - no installers, no reboots
- **Hybrid Approach**: Visual workflows + full C# power when needed
- **Blazing Fast**: Native AOT compilation, millisecond startup
- **Live Coding**: Write C# directly in workflow nodes with IntelliSense
- **Cross Platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS - same binary

## 🏗️ Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Architecture and core engine in progress
